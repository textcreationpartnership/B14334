            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>He that can make himselfe so cheape to giue vnask't, certainly giues that which is not worth taking, else hee would neuer make such haste to be rid of it. Thus to

An assertion to be hissed at, not answered, being quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Christs</hi> rule, who layes so much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to our charge, that wee haue not power to thinke well, much lesse to will that which is good, without his assisting grace, nor to auoid one danger hanging o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs, without the same grace preuenting.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:177033:17"/> words barely repeated, apply themselues. They were Christs Disciples vnto whom he gaue this exemplified iniunction: I trust so are we; nor doth this speech with lesse proprietie or necessitie belong to you, then it did to them.</p>
            <p>So that you see the Disciples themselues were taught: If they who had <hi>Maiorem men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suram sanctificationis,</hi> and <hi>Dona infusa,</hi> such a large proportion of grace, and gifts of the Spirit infused, thought it no disparagement to be directed and tied to a paterne, I doe not see why any of meaner endowments should thinke themselues too wise to learne of Christ, or to <hi>Pray after his manner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, though Disciples, and in that neere relation to Christ, then corporally present with them, yet for all that they must pray.</p>
            <p>The best that liues vpon the earth, though he can boast neuer so neere an alliance to Christ, hath need of praier, else all his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse can be no <hi>Supersedeas</hi> for temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. A wall'd Towne is no protection from the enemie, without a garrison to beat
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:177033:17"/> him from the walls, nor doth the place se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it, but the watch. So the strength of mans owne righteousnesse is no fortresse to secure him, vnlesse religion guard him, and that his prayers stand centinell, <hi>Watch and pray,</hi> solliciting the Watchman of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael to defend him in all assaults. There is no faith so well built, or freed from decay, that needs not be repaired hourely by the inuocation of Gods assistance. The iust man falls <hi>Septies in die,</hi> seuen times a day: how oft then falls he, that hath no claime to righteousnesse, nor any title but what is deriued from his sinnes? He therefore that is fallen, must pray that he may rise, and <hi>Qui stat videat ne cadat,</hi> He that yet stands must pray to preuent his fall. For as Saint <hi>Augustine, Fusa oratio fidei impetrat firmita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> Prayer is the base, the pedestall of faith.</p>
            <p>There be many that neuer serue God but when they need him. <hi>Quando bella,</hi>

            <p>'Tis a dangerous opinion for any to thinke he hath no need of God. And 'tis high time God should grow weary of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good to that man, who growes weary of seruing him. An intermittent pulse is one of the fore-runners of death, and a ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation from Prayer, which is the Soules pulse, shewing all her sicke distempers, wants and grieuances, is the argument of a desperat forlorne condition.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:177033:23"/> Prayer by Number but by Weight. God regards not how many prayers men string with their Beads, but with what deuotion they send them vp; nor doth he keepe a Score or Tally of our Petitions, though hee bottle vp and number each religious Teare shed in the vehement imploring of his Grace. The Excellence, not the Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metike of this Prayer, is my obiect, which <hi>Hugo Cardinalis</hi> commends vnto vs in three obseruations; <hi>In Dignitate,</hi>

               <p>For the Dignity, <hi>Christ</hi> was the Author <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> of it, <hi>Qui fecit viuere docuit orare.</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> saith, this is that <hi>verbum breuians,</hi>

                  <hi>Quoniam sermonem breuiatum faciet Deus in toto orbe terrae.</hi> The reason why it was comprised in so few words are seuerally alleaged by the Fathers: one is, that it might be more portable in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories,<note place="margin">Cyprian.</note>

Therefore Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> giues a strict charge that young children should first of all learne this Prayer,<note place="margin">Aug.

               <p>The last Argument of this Prayers excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> is the fulnesse and weight of it.<note place="margin">Facunditas.</note> In few words it inuolues most copious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and though very briefe, yet it is of an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple sense.<note place="margin">Tertull. de orat.</note>

               <p>You see the large capacity of this Prayer, how that it comprehends the subiect of all other prayers; and not them only, but euen all Christian discipline, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> writes:<note place="margin">Tertull lib. de orat.</note> for which cause he stiles it <hi>Breuiarium totius Euangelij;</hi> the Abridgement of the whole Gospell.

               <p>So that in this short Prayer, as in a little Orbe, the Sonne of righteousnesse moues: from hence doth euery Starre, euery faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full seruant and Confessor of Christ (for they are Incarnate Starres)<note place="margin">Nazianzen.</note> borrow a ray of light to illuminate and sanctifie the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of his meditations.

               <p>Whither since I haue at last conducted your Meditations, there will I leaue them.

               <p>I know, our aduersaries, the Papists, set their Disciples a lower course, directing their Deuotions to <hi>Compostella</hi> or <hi>Loretto,</hi> or the Shrines of Saints, or the Sepulchre
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:177033:38"/> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but these are no obiects for our Religion or piety. Heauen must be the receptacle of our Prayers.

So that the more wee contemplate this Theme, the more must we admire the perfection of the Lesson, and the singular method of the Teacher. 'Twas not enough that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed vs what to pray, prescribing vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall remedies for our necessities out of this precious Saluatory, but he must shew vs also where to beginne the cure. 'Twas not enough for him to leuy this Masse of Deuotion, to haue mustered and drawne together the obiect of all Petitions into these seuen Battalions, but as hee is our Captaine and Leader,<note place="margin">

               <p>This Petition stands in the head of the Troope, being brought vp before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to acknowledge the power of that Name which could giue successe to all we sought for in the rest of them. <hi>Constantine</hi> wore that victorious Motto in his Banner, <hi>In hôc vinces.</hi>

               <p>'Tis not abundance of worldly blessings which should take vp our meditations or desires, but the aduancement of his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Name, who hath created those Mines and Veines of treasure in the Earth. <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> as'kt not at Gods hand Wealth but Wisdome, nor did he couenant with him for gold and siluer when he dedicated the Temple, but that whensoeuer hee or his people should worship and inuocate his Name in that Place, he would be gracious and propitious to them.

               <p>In former Ages of the world, Men had
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:177033:46"/> onely one Name, but as the world multi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>plied, so did Names also.

               <p>If at any time we will mention the King or Kingdome, let it be in our Prayers, our Commission reaches no further. For our blessed Sauiour did as straitly charge vs by the mouth of his Apostle, to pray for Kings and the present prosperity of those King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes he hath established on Earth, as by his owne Mouth he hath taught vs to pray

               </p>
               <p>The parts are two:</p>

               </p>
               <p>But did hee teach vs onely to Pray for Kingdomes and Princes, and not also to giues thankes for them? Certainly, if the Apostles rule hold, that wee must <hi>giue Thankes for all men,</hi> much more for those that are the best of Men, Princes: And if for Princes, how much more for the Best of that ranke? improued to that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlatiue, not by the partiall rate of our affections (which might bee allowed to value him in that degree, because ours) but weighed in the vnpartiall balance of Merit, which cannot lye, nor needs the least graine of flattery or fauour to make Him more currant in the Worlds opinion.</p>
               <p>Me thinkes I should not goe on in this

                  </note> and not first giue Him thankes for the comming home of our owne.</p>
               <p>Indeed our Kingdome shifted place, our Iland swam from vs and made an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road vpon the Continent, where awhile it stucke. Yea our Hearts trauelled from vs, bound on a voyage in which all our Hopes were aduentured.</p>
               <p>They are now return'd, and we fixt in our owne Center againe.

               <p>Yet some may say, this Ceremony is ended, and therefore suppose the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it sounds out of date. I thinke not so.

               <p>The mercies which God affords vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire many daies of payment, we cannot discharge them at one entire solution. Some blessings God hath bestowed on vs, for which we haue taken aboue fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeeres to satisfie him, so long haue we beene thanking Him for our <hi>Election,</hi> which was more ancient than the world,

               <p>I am not so mad to compare these anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent mercies of God with any later. New benefits hold no proportion, nor deserue to be named with them; yet this I know, God that did allow so many Hundred yeeres of thanksgiuing for Spirituall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, doth allow a few daies for Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall. And if so, I come within my time to pay my thankes, nor can I forfeit any thing to his discretion, that will censure this mention vnfit or vnseasonable. Not to trouble you with a receit of many words, <hi>Sueton</hi> writes,<note place="margin">In Caligula.</note> when the newes of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus</hi> his welfare came to <hi>Rome,</hi> the people welcommed it with Lights and Fires, and this shout, <hi>Salua Roma, Salua Patria, Saluus Germanicus;</hi> turne it to <hi>Britanicus,</hi> and the Acclamation vpon this happy returne may be ours, <hi>Salua Patria, Saluus Britanicus,</hi> our

And as He is the Branch of a most Royall Stocke, may He spread like Him, that our Hopes may rest and build in his Boughes, and vnder them the Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth be sheltered.</p>
               <p>Nor let it seeme vncharitable or vnchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian to anathematize them, who doe not beare a part in this Ioy and in this Prayer for the good of our Kingdome, from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any part in the Kingdome of Christ which here we sue for, <hi>Adueniat Regnum tuum.</hi>

               <p>The Schoolemen that deale altogether vpon distinction, and would, if it were possible, diuide Christs seamlesse Coat, haue variously diuided this Kingdome of His, made it an Heptarchy. For they doe not only vnderstand by <hi>Regnum Tuum,</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:177033:65"/> that Generall Administration whereby he gouernes all things, or the Kingdome of Grace, or that of Glory, but they make <hi>Regnum Scripturae,</hi> and <hi>Regnum Ecclesiae Militantis,</hi> The Scripture and the Church Kingdomes. They make <hi>Locum Beatitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> the place where the blessed Saints con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template God, a Kingdome; Nay, by a bold figure they erect a Throne in the Kings owne Person, take Christ himselfe for a Kingdome.</p>
               <p>For all which I deny not but they may haue colourable warrant from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet I shall not hold their course, or stay to view so many Kingdomes as their Discoueries haue trauelled thorow.</p>
               <p>I rest vpon that proper construction of <hi>Regnum Tuum,</hi> which imports Christs Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration as He is head of the Church, and by his sacred Word (which is the Law whereby His Kingdome is gouerned) subiects the Faith and obedience of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants to himselfe.</p>
               <p>Which acception will fully determine in two others contained vnder it, <hi>The
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:177033:65"/> Kingdome of Grace,</hi> and <hi>the Kingdome of Glory.</hi> And howeuer the last of these is the finall Obiect of our Praiers; yet is the first a disposition and necessary meanes to attaine the other. He that prayes for the Kingdom of Glory, and hath not a sufficient stocke of Grace to maintaine and beare vp that Petition, builds without his foundation. He is like one that attempts to flye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wings, or like a Proiector, that in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neerer waies to profit or preferment than by the beaten path, beguiles himselfe at last: he sends vp his Prayers as vainly as children doe their Arrowes into the aire, which fall backe as fast as they shoot them vp.</p>
               <p>The Kingdome of Glory presumes that of Grace; As the Peace which God giues vs in this World, is a pledge of our future peace in the other, so is Grace the earnest of our Glory. None can be admitted into the Triumphant Church, but who hath first serued in the Militant, and none can bee made free of the Kingdome of Glory, but hee who hath serued his time in the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:177033:66"/> Kingdome of Grace. Therefore by good right doe we here pray for the Kingdome of Grace, as well as for the Kingdome of Glory.</p>
               <p>Yet our <hi>Adueniat,</hi> when it referres to the Kingdome of Grace, doth not looke on it, as on a thing altogether absent, but as not yet fully come. The Kingdome of God indeed hath beene come amongst vs euer since Christs time, and we haue liued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reigne of Grace euer since the Law was abolished and the Gospell establisht; but this Kingdome is yet straitened, beares not it's full bredth, nor is it arriued at it's perfect growth. Wee therefore yet Pray, <hi>Adueniat,</hi> for the dilation, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, the perfection of this Empire. So long as the <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> that rich Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banet, wherein the Graces and Mercies of God are lockt vp, is opened with the right Key, vnderstood in the true vpright mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, and preserued in that height of dignity which Christ appointed to it, not wrested to make Heresie authenticall, nor abased so low as to make Tradition Iudge
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:177033:66"/> of it; so long (I say) as the lustre of it is not dim'd, but the dignity preserued religiously amongst vs, so long haue we the earnest of Saluation and pledge of Grace deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with vs; but where it is quite lockt vp from Gods people, and the Keyes kept in the Popes Chamber, that the Laity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not open it at all, nor when it is opened, must vnderstand it any way but how hee pleases, how it serues best for his aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, Where Tales and Fables beare more authority then Diuine Stories, Where the Legend is in stead of Bibles, and mans stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Traditions valued aboue Gods Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I feare the Kingdome of Grace hath lost much ground there, that there it is, since the first comming of it, almost gone, almost extinct, and that the curse which was throwne vpon the hard-hearted Iewes that would <hi>not see what they saw, nor vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what they read,</hi> hath trenched ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry deepe vpon it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 21 43.</note>
                  <hi>Auferetur Regnum Dei à vobis; The Kingdome of God shall be taken away from you:</hi> That is, <hi>Intelligentia spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alis Scripturae sacrae,</hi> the true vnderstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:177033:67"/> and estimation of the Scripture shall be remoued from you.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Adueniat</hi> therefore must stand in the Gates of our lips, to disperse this Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker that it neuer eat vpon our Church, that the dangerous teeth of this curse neuer fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten vpon vs, but that the Word of God may still be as open to our Vnderstanding, as it is free and open for vs to Heare in all Churches of this Land.</p>
               <p>Againe, so long as the Gospell of Christ, which is the Euidence of his Grace is min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced or dam'd vp in any Circumstances, so that the Current is hindred and cannot flow with a free liberall streame, it shewes the Kingdome of Grace is not fully come. We must therefore open the course with our <hi>Adueniat,</hi> pray that the Obstacles may be remoued, and those Sluces that either stop or diuert the naturall Current of it may be taken vp; that so it may finde no let or opposition through the Christian World. Let mee adde Saint <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> exposition. So long as our earthly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are predominant, and a peruerse will
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:177033:67"/> ouer-rules the vnderstanding, so long as the flesh is in rebellion against the Spirit and preuailes, the Kingdome of Grace is not yet come. But when the Spirit hath subdued the Earthly Man, 'tis an Infallible token of the Kingdome of Grace. Our <hi>Adueniat</hi> therefore prayes for the setting vp of this Kingdome in mans selfe (which the Schooles call <hi>Regnum animae</hi>) as well as for Christs Kingdome.<note place="margin">Chrysost.</note> He that by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and reason hath subiected that earth which lies in his Temper, he (saith <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi>) is Lord of himselfe. And <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> out of that old Maxime, <hi>Si vis tibi om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia subijcere, subijce te rationi,</hi> inferres; He is not fit to reigne with Christ in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who hath not first ouercome all worldly passions, and beene King ouer himselfe.</p>
               <p>Lastly, whilst the sound of the Gospell hath not gone out into all Nations, whilst there is a World layed open to our disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery which hath not discouered Christ, nor heard of Him (like those in the <hi>Acts</hi> who had not heard whether there were a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:177033:68"/> or no) the Kingdome of Grace is not yet come so amply as it should bee. Wee must therefore daily propagate it in our Prayers, beseeching God that all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may entertaine his Truth, that so Christ may be Lord from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beershe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> from Sea to Sea, from one side of the Continent to the other. And then, where there is this Extent of Grace, where there is this Vnity of Faith, and Harmony of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion through the world, 'tis the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate fore-runner of Christs last glorious Aduent: the Kingdome of Grace is then at a Period, and giues way to the last Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy which euer shall be, <hi>The Kingdome of Glory,</hi> which is the full scope of our <hi>Adue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niat, Thy Kingdome come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus wee can make shift to delineate, though in a rude imperfect Modell, the Kingdome of Grace, but the Kingdome of Glory we cannot. On that we are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to looke at the distance whereat Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men discouer Land, and our hopes are as remote from vs, as they from Harbour, which they onely beginne to ken, and no

                     <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.12.</note> Or as <hi>Moses</hi> from the top of <hi>Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim</hi> suruaied the Land of Promise, and tooke possession of the Soile with his eye; so from this Mount of Grace are we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to descry that higher Mount of Glory, whose top reaches the highest Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, To taste it in the promises of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, and take possession of it, <hi>Oculo fidei,</hi> with the Eye of our Faith, till our selues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seated in it, the Eyes of our Body shall hereafter see all that we now beleeue.</p>
               <p>We are suffered to discerne that to bee our Gole, may descry the Host of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, Angels and Saints there assembled, and haue a glimpse <hi>of that Crowne of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse</hi> which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speakes of,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8.</note> and read that promise writ in the Circle of it, <hi>Si compatimur conregnabimus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12.</note> that we shall after that great day of Coronation reigne for euer with Christ: but here our eye dazles, dimme and vnable to behold any more; the Consequence of that blisse is vnutterable, the Measure of it not to bee taken by so weake a Perspectiue as the Eye. <hi>The eye hath not seene,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>So then the Kingdome of Grace is not our Petitions full scope, it onely is the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger to fit vs for the life of Glory, as <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> was to prepare the way for Christ. And as <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> could no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise describe the Excellency of Him that was to come after him, but onely by accusing his owne vnworthinesse,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Non sum dignus, I am not worthy to vntie his shooe-latchet;</hi> so can we no way discipher the Kingdome of Glory and the ioyes there treasured vp, but by professing our selues vnworthy to vtter, and vnable to figure it in any other Mould but in our wishes and Petitions, praying to God <hi>That it may come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what language doth this <hi>Adueniat</hi>

Doe we accuse God of slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that He tarries too long? or doe wee dare His comming? Or doe we doubt it? like those in the Prophet, <hi>Qui dicunt festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Or doe we thinke our request can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile with Him to alter the prefixt day of his arriuall, to change the Iesses of that great Iourney, and come sooner than in his eternall purpose he hath decreed? certainly none of these.

'Tis so speedy and we so dull, we cannot keepe wing with it, but shall be cast behind so farre as the foolish Virgins were, nor can we euer be able to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:177033:70"/> recouer that ground which our slow im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouidence hath lost.

               </p>
               <p>Lastly, 'tis no impatient voice of a man weary of Gods stay, or not content to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his leisure, but rather like the shout of men harnessed and prepared for the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, which declares our readinesse to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter Him, not silently awaiting his comming, but whilst he is yet on his way making out to meet Him, and standing ready to welcome his arriuall, his Iourney towards vs with the loud acclamation of an <hi>Adueniat Regnum tuum, Thy Kingdome come.</hi>

               <p>I haue spoke all, and in this short Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrase vpon the <hi>Adueniat</hi> in my Text, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered the full vse we all must make of this Petition: which is, to make our selues as ready for the Kingdome of Glory, as that is ready for vs, to set our selues as neere to God, as the approaching day of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is neere to vs. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> long since proclaimed this Kingdome to be at hand, and in the <hi>Reuelat.</hi> that <hi>Ecce venio,</hi>

               <p>HItherto our Petitions haue beene in the ascent, raising and working themselues vpon the wings of this Prayer. They are now climbed to the highest pitch, the <hi>Culmen &amp; fastigium,</hi> Top of this Mount of God. For the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of Gods Will is next in height to his owne Presence, nay 'tis Himselfe. Wee can put no difference betwixt his <hi>Essence</hi> and his <hi>Will.</hi> Now because this is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in Man, whose Will is a faculty of the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:177033:72"/> soule, and not his Essence;</p>
               <p>My first part shall be to shew the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> betwixt <hi>voluntas tua,</hi> and <hi>voluntas Hominis, Gods Will</hi> and <hi>Mans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I shall declare what this Will <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of God is, and the seuerall Acceptions of it, which is the contemplatiue part; Inuoluing <hi>Totū theologiae,</hi> the whole body of diuinity.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, how this Will of His is to bee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> fulfilled, which is the Practicke part of the Petition; and indeed <hi>Totum Religionis,</hi> the Maine scope of Religion: In the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming whereof, the whole Law and the Prophets are fulfilled; <hi>Fiat, Thy Will be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, I shall present vnto you the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> proposed vnto vs, according to which, Religion and our Endeuours must worke; <hi>Sicut in Coelo, In Earth as it is in Heauen;</hi> and this is the perfection of this Petition, which is the Exemplary part.</p>
               <p>First, of the consideration of <hi>voluntas <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Tua</hi> and <hi>Hominis, Gods Will</hi> and <hi>Mans.</hi> Like the distance betwixt Heauen and Earth, such is the disproportion betwixt God and Man. God sees not as Man sees, nor
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:177033:73"/> doth He Will like him. The Will of Man is moued by occasions, altered by chance; but the Will of God, like the <hi>Persian</hi> Lawes, stands irreuocable, neither to be resisted nor reuersed.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Adams</hi> priuilege was called in, the Will was abridged too, and allowed lesse freedome than before. If it now haue any Liberty, 'tis Negatiue. It is in a Mans owne Will and choice whether he will do any foule fact, perpetrate an Ill, for <hi>Homo est liberè malus,</hi> nothing compels or laies an ineuitable necessity of sinning vpon him; 'tis free for him to auoid it. No loose Starre bawdes him in his inordinate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires; no angry Planet guides his hand to Murther; no watry Influence vrges him to that familiar sinne now growne a fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable complement, Drunkennesse. Hee may auoid the Actions of sinne, though not the Offers. Those <hi>Primi motus,</hi> moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and seeds of sinne, which are scattered vpon his whole being, will bud and put forth a blade. Though the Heart of Man be neuer so well manured by Grace, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:177033:73"/> sowne with graine of better value; for all that, Originall sinne will send vp those ranke weedes, those wild tares to grow amongst our best Haruests, as the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances and Characters of that taint wee beare about vs.</p>
               <p>Now although Man be <hi>Liberè malus,</hi> he is not <hi>Liberè bonus;</hi> Though it be in his Election to act no mischiefe, 'tis more than he can vndertake to doe any Good; yea, or to thinke well, without the assistance of God.</p>
               <p>The liberty of Will consists not <hi>In in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differentia ad vtrum{que} contrariorum</hi> (which is the state of the question, and the termes of quarrell betwixt vs and the Papists touching Free-will) in an Indifferency to Will that which is Good or that is Euill, but onely <hi>In immunitate à Coactione,</hi> in an immunity from any Coaction; a man is not good against his Will, nor is there any Necessity of sinning laied vpon him.</p>
               <p>So that this Liberty is clogged with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint.</p>
               <q>Cum fugit à collô trabitur pars longa catenae.<note place="margin">Pers. Sat. <hi>5.</hi>

               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:177033:74"/>

Though the Soule must haue the highest regard, the Body must haue a share, and a degree in our regard. For how can wee iustifie the neglect of that Body for the present, which God hath decreed to Glorifie hereafter? Of which future
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:177033:92"/> Glory he hath giuen this earnest, that hee hath alotted a roome in this Praier meerely for things conducing to the Bodies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision.</p>
               <p>It is not strange that God who hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken so strict an Inuentory of Man, that the very least <hi>haire of his head</hi> is entred in his Registry,<note place="margin">

               <p>Against all therefore that professe the Science of Want and Willing Pouertie, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all those that tyrannize ouer Nature, and execute a iustice vpon themselues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Gods commission, by staruing the Body, let mee oppose this Petition, as an inducement to them not to be cruell to their owne Flesh, and as an argument of Gods impartiall care of the Body, as of the Soule. And you may obserue how farre he carries this care, euen thorow all his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and our courses. There is not so great
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:177033:92"/> a disproportion betwixt the Soule and the Body, as betwixt God and Man; yet in those acts which concerne our profit and his Glory, He so farre condescends to vs, that He allowes vs more time for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage than He takes to Himselfe. Of the Seuen dayes in the weeke, Six He allowes to Mans industrie, to doe his worke in, to buy and sell, to plant Vineyards, and to reape the fruits of the Earth, reseruing only one Sabbath, the Seuenth day, for the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his Name.</p>
               <p>And of the Seuen Petitions in this Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, this <hi>Ephaemerides</hi> of Praier, Christ hath ordained a more liberall share to Man than to Himselfe: for only Three of them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and immediately concerne his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and the Honour of his Name, the Foure last were intended for helps to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate Man whilst he liues here in the World.</p>
               <p>This Petition is our first step to Earth: In the three former wee made our ascents and approches towards Heauen; here our Deuotion flies at a lower pitch, and stoops

               <p>Of such a profuse benignitie is He, that for feare lest our owne Necessities should not be imperious enough, vrge vs fast enough to seeke his helpe, He with them laies his command on vs, and indents with vs, makes a perpetuall Couenant that wee shall require his assistance when wee need it:<note place="margin">

               <p>How different is the Worlds custome from his? There is a wretched kinde of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacitie predominant in the disposition of Man, who is generally in nothing more close than in giuing, nor more reseru'd than in doing good to his brethren.

               <p>When I consider with how much delay

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:177033:95"/> of Nature were at once barr'd against him: for at first the Earth wore her commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in her forehead, visible and eminent, but after Mans fall she by Gods command calld in her blessings, conceald her fruits, and in stead of that plenty wherein once she was apparelled, now only weares that barren attire which Gods curse cast vpon her, <hi>Thornes and Thistles.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>S.

                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 6.31.</note> But the Father doth not sooner moue the scruple than solue it. <hi>Alexander Hales</hi> hath made vp his answer in a short distinction; There is (saith he) <hi>Solicitudo curiositatis,</hi> a curious care to please the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with varietie of diet, and there is <hi>Soli citudo diligentiae,</hi> an honest diligence that aimes but at a competent allowance to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:177033:99"/> hunger. Tis only the first solicitude Christ forbids, not the last.</p>
               <p>Certainly if wee measure this Petition Literally according to its Obiect, wee shall finde the Word pretends no curiositie. Tis but Bread wee aske. The smallest, most tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate request which Pouertie can put vp, and the lowest rate Bounty or Charity can be seized at. You see how small a bredth the word carries in our acception, yet Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his construction enlarges it very farre, and will haue it signifie all kinds of meat, <hi>Panis pro omni cibo.</hi> But the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew stretches the sense so wide, that vnder this word <hi>Bread</hi> it hath inuolued all things that tend to the sustentation or support of our life, as Health, Plenty, Peace. And as <hi>Manna</hi> the Bread from Heauen humoured the palate so farre,<note place="margin">

               <p>By these seuerall steps doth the significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this word <hi>Bread</hi> dilate it selfe, thus wide doth it stretch in the naturall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:177033:100"/> and the Mysticall sense is as ample as the other. For as it signifies <hi>Panem corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralem,</hi> that Bread which nourisheth the Body,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ecclesiastic.</hi> 15.1.</note> so doth it also <hi>Panem vitae &amp; iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> that Bread of Life which is the Word of God, wherewith the Pastors feed Christs flocke.

               <p>This is the summe of all that the Schooles say concerning the word <hi>Bread.</hi> Which is broken by them into Fiue parts. First, <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralis,</hi> our common Bread. Secondly, <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritualis,</hi> Bread in a spirituall sense, which is
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:177033:100"/>
                  <hi>Panis Iustitiae,</hi> Righteousnesse. Thirdly, <hi>Doctrinalis,</hi> the Doctrinall Bread distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Gods Dispensers, the Preachers. Fourthly, <hi>Sacramentalis,</hi> that hallowed Bread which wee receiue in the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Fiftly, <hi>Aeternalis,</hi> that eternall Bread of Life which wee hope to be partakers of in the World to come, of which our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our sayes, <hi>Ego sum Panis viuus.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 6.35.</note> I may adde one other Species of Bread, which the Psalmist calls <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I shall not erect any large discourse on these foundations. Only thus: Wee must remember, <hi>Man liues not by Bread only,</hi>

                  <hi>but by the Word of God.</hi> And that euen the Soule, our best part, hath her decayes as well as the Body, and requires a repaire as speedy: She is sensible of wants and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, hath her part of Hunger and Thirst, and that in a degree so farre exalted aboue the corporall hunger, as her subtile essence is sublimated and refined aboue the Body: In which kinde of sense the Psalmist sayes,

               <p>Againe, because the Bread which wee eat in the Sacrament is <hi>viaticum animae</hi> (as <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>I finde the two Euangelists <hi>S. Matthew</hi> and <hi>S. Luke</hi> somewhat differently transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Vulgar. <hi>S. Matthew</hi> hath <hi>Panem supersubstantialem; S. Luke, Quotidianum.</hi> I meane not to dispute the cause of this difference, or the truth of the translation.

                  </note> that <hi>S. Matthew</hi> spake to the capacitie of the learned, <hi>Orationem Dominicam scripsit vt perfectis conueniebat;</hi> but <hi>S. Luke</hi> spake to the vnderstanding of the rude and vnlet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, as well as the other. <hi>Supersubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi> (saith <hi>Alexander Hales</hi>) is a word that few vnderstand, but <hi>Quotidianus</hi> is the more easie and familiar: Therefore because this Praier was to be commonly vsed by all sorts of Men, the Church determined to
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:177033:102"/> vse this word <hi>Quotidianus, Daily Bread,</hi> as most proper to informe al vnderstandings.</p>
               <p>But vpon this ground and concession let mee aske, vnto whose capacitie did the <hi>Rhemists</hi> fit their translation? when they read, <hi>Giue vs our supersubstantiall Bread.</hi> Did they intend it for the vse of Scholars, or generally for the People? If for them, why would they offer with strange dresses to disfigure our Mother Tongue, to attire it in the Roman garbe, blending the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish with so much Latine, that they vtterly disguise it from vulgar apprehensions. I cannot conceiue what darke designe they had in obscuring the Text with so much vnknowne compound sophisticate Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, vsing not only here, but thorowout their whole Translation, such words as but Schollars none can vnderstand, vnlesse besides that plot, in which their whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hath long laboured, to benight the Church of Christ, and cast a generall mist of ignorance to blinde the World, that it should not discerne this Truth, they haue a plot vpon God himselfe, and would, if it
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:177033:102"/> were possible, make Him speake in as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne a tongue to the Congregation, as they themselues speake to the People, and teach the People to pray vnto Him.</p>
               <p>Wee that studie perspicuitie embrace the common, and by best iudgements most approued, word <hi>Quotidianus,</hi> both because by it <hi>Generaliùs exprimuntur petenda,</hi> 'tis of more spatious signification than <hi>Supersub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantialis,</hi>

Yet how euer it be in it selfe of so significatiue an extent, 'tis set vp to vs as a Boundary to limit our vast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and empale the wilde appetite. If we may compare this Petition to a Terrestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Globe, this must be the Meridian to gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle it about; by it must wee take the length and bredth of our requests.

The Syriacke Translation expresses
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:177033:103"/> it fully, <hi>Panis indigentiae,</hi> Bread to resist Hunger and repaire Nature.</p>

               <p>In the practise of our Law, wee finde it is not safe for a delinquent to put himselfe vpon his purgation, if his guilt lie in preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant proofe: Peremptory attempts of iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication rather exasperate Iustice; which is in nothing more softned, than by one who (strooke with remorse) pleads guiltie to his Inditement. Tis iust thus in Gods Courts, who deemes it a contumacie in Man to diminish an offence committed against Him by vaine apologie or excuse; when wee are sure that many by anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Iustice, and by an vnurged Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of their Crime, haue appeased the Iudge, and acquitted themselues. The Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans bashfull contrition, that was afraid to make his approaches too neere the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and ashamed to looke that way his
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:177033:116"/> sinne had ascended, won pity from his lips who had the power to absolue him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the proud garbe of the Pharisee, who (saith <hi>S. Augustine) Superbè gratias egit,</hi> thankt God for a fauour he neuer had, was condemned.</p>
               <p>He that thinkes to beare vp himselfe by his owne merit, hangs a golden weight about his necke, that will choake him at last. A man must not thinke to turne the scale of Gods Iustice by iustifying himselfe. That which he thinks Righteousnesse in himselfe, is not so indeed; and that which is so, is not his, but Gods, Lent and Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Him. Tis a proud Ingratitude there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for a Man enricht only by Deuotion and Loane, to lift vp himselfe against that hand from whence he borrowed it.

                  <hi>Tertullian</hi> renders, <hi>Quod perinde iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicio debeatur, &amp; ab eo exigatur;</hi> because it binds a man ouer to a future account, and in the day of Iudgement euery offence will be required and charged vpon the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.<note place="margin">Pamelius Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat. in Lib.

                  <hi>Nam sicut Debitor à Creditore requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur, ita peccatum à Deo in Die Iudicii ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse est exigatur.</hi> So <hi>Fortunatus</hi> amplifies it.</p>
               <p>As there is a difference in Debts, some being Greater and others Lesse, so is there in Sinnes too: Some are more hainous, and shal haue a seuerer punishment than sinnes
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:177033:122"/> of a lower degree. And yet all Debts from the greatest to the least are payable, and all sinnes from the foulest to the cheapest, from the wilfull Offence to the sinne of Ignorance, are punishable. The quantitie of the Debt doth not make it more a Debt, though it make it greater. He that lends a penny is a Creditor in as true a sense, as he that lends a pound: and one that is indeb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but in a small summe, hath as much right to answer it backe from whence it was borrowed, as hee that is ingaged in a Million.</p>
               <p>It being then granted that there is the same reason in Sinnes, as in Debts, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes by necessary consequence, That by the rule of Iustice, the least sinnes are as liable to punishment, as are the least Debts to payment.<note place="margin">No sinnes Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall.</note> From which conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I ground a direct <hi>Antithesis</hi> against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which allowes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of veniall sinnes. For so their writers distinguish sinne <hi>in Mortale &amp; Veniale,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Mortall and Veniall, whereas there is no sin which is not mortall. The debt of sin
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:177033:123"/> is Iudgement, and the Valuation Death: Therefore as the smallest Coine which beares the Kings Impresse is currant as well as the greatest: so the slightest offence hath its proportionable rate and value in the account of Gods Iustice, as any of an Higher Nature.</p>
               <p>Who will deny that Pilferings are Thefts, or that our Lawes punish Theft as well as Murther? or who knowes not but that hee that Robs a Cottage though hee take little, nay though he take nothing, is in as much danger of an Arraignment as hee that robs a Palace? There is no sinne we can commit which is lesse in quantitie than the point of any of those Thornes which were platted in Christs Coronet, &amp; yet the least of those Thornes prickt Him, the least drew Bloud from Him. Shall wee then so farre vnderualue any sinne, as to call that Veniall which was rated in any degree of Christs sufferings, or proportion of his Bloud? That precious, vnualuable Bloud, whose least drop had beene enough to pay the ransome of the whole World,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:177033:123"/> and make a full expiation for all sinne! There is nothing more dangerous to a Christian, than to slight or diminish an offence; To say to thy selfe, I haue done no Murther, I haue committed no Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, I haue violated no mans Bed, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed my owne Temple, which is my Body, but the Holy Ghosts Chapell; These are sinnes which might bring mee in danger of damnation, but I haue done no such: If I haue thought ill, that Thought was neuer brought to an Act; though it sprang from my infirmitie, yet that infirmitie ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had strength to bring it forth, but like an Abortiue it perisht againe in that womb wherein it was conceiued: Therefore I hope God will be more mercifull than pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish my purposes with death, to condemn mee for that I neuer did, for that which was only form'd and cast in my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not full shaped. Surely I hope so too. And our hope in Christs Mercy is a <hi>Rocke</hi> whose foundation will neuer faile. But yet for all that, like wise builders, wee must build the right way, or else our building
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:177033:124"/> will proue in vaine. And certainly he that trusts vpon the diminution of a sinne, builds vpon the falsest foundation that may be. For to let small sinnes run on, out of a hope that they are not worthy Gods taking notice, or, if He doe take notice, that they are not worthy of his anger, is not Hope, but Presumption, and so our Hope is turned into a sinne.</p>
               <p>Alas wee flatter our selues in our securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, if we thinke there be any Veniall sinne, or if we thinke that our Thoughts or lasci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uious lookes are only the Abortions of sinne, and not sinne. He that imagineth euill is the Author (saith <hi>Salomon.</hi>) For <hi>The wicked thought is sinne.</hi>

                     <hi>Prou.</hi> 24.8, 9.</note> And Christ hath pronounced, that incontinent wishes are adulteries;<note place="margin">

                  <hi>He that seeth a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then, Thoughts are sins, and Lookes are sins, which (not repented) will, if not absolutely condemne, (which though I am not peremptory to pronounce, I dare not be so coole in Gods cause as to deny) yet proue as sluces to let in damnation, and
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:177033:124"/> worke wholly vnto that vnhappy end; as the smallest Leake which is sprung at Sea may, if neglected, let in water to drowne the tallest Ship. Therefore if the Tide of sinne haue washt, though neuer so lightly, ouer thy Banke, if a Temptation haue floa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in vpon thy Soule by any of thy Fiue Ports, thy Senses, make vp the Breach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, lest a Tide or two more ouerwhelme and lay thee quite vnder water.

Stop then thy eare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those Romish Charmers that would besot thee with the confidence of <hi>Veniall Sinnes,</hi> I meane, that some sinnes are so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thou needest not aske pardon for them.

How then can it stand with his goodnesse to be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor for reprobation, or a Confederate in that Act which he abhorres?</p>
               <p>I know, <hi>Temptation</hi> is the concurrence of Time, and Place, and subiects appliable to both; And howeuer in it selfe it be lesse than the Fact, yet considered in the Author, that inuites sinne by these opportunities, it shall farre outgoe it. The infirmitie of a Sinner may sometimes finde excuse or pity,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:177033:143"/> but what shadow of excuse can shelter his malice that drew him to the Act?</p>
               <p>Tis more hatefull to be sinnes Bawd, than to be the subiect of it. The first is the Actiue part of Vice, the last is Passiue. The first Nurses it, the last receiues it; And, if the milke be empoisoned, you will rather blame the Nurse that gaue it, than the Childe that drew it in. Tis not the Wax, but the Impression of the Seale that fortifies a Conueyance, and makes the Deed. Man is a thing easily perswaded to errour,<note place="margin">Iuuenal.</note>
                  <hi>Cereus in vitium flecti,</hi> like wax wrought to a soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that will receiue the Figure of any Vice. And yet we blame not his softnesse, but lament him, whose credulitie and easie temper betrayes him to euery Temptation.</p>
               <p>If wee lay the occasion of Mans fault aright, wee must lay it on the Tempter: At his allurements did <hi>Adams</hi> obedience relent, his perswasions heated him with the inordinate desire of knowledge: Hee chafte this wax, mollifying it with such art, that it receiued his Authenticke Seale of damnation, by which Sinne was made cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:177033:143"/> in the World. Had there beene no Tempter, happily Men had neuer beene ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Sinne. And we may iustly thinke, it was the Serpent made him fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with that mischiefe, which his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent disposition then knew not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Temptation</hi> then is but an instruction How and When to sinne, a subtile engine seruing to encourage and giue aime to those faults, which our frailtie is perfect in without a Prompter.

               <p>You may obserue how carefull God was in preuenting Mans ruine, who did not only warne him of the danger when hee was yet out of the distance of it, but in the very conflict it selfe suggested a meanes

               <p>The Direction, and Explication of the Matters seuerally contained in the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, hath beene my former Subiect. That which remaines here to make vp my last treatise, is like that Ciuill and Mannerly Ceremony, which wee vsually referre to the latter part of our Letters, wherein wee mention our Acknowledgment and Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well together.</p>
               <p>I doe not call it a Ceremony any way to diminish or lessen the dignitie of the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:177033:171"/> words. They haue their weight and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie confirm'd by Him who dictated the rest. Nor are they vnnecessary or vse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, though only annexed, not incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated into the Prayer. Though our Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Parts, as Soule and Body, be the maine Foundations of our Being, none will deny but that the Integrals, as Hands and Feet, are necessary assistants both to serue and adorne our Being.</p>
               <p>Of the nature of Integrall Parts are these words; which as they haue their Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, so they are Necessary too.</p>
               <p>They are the gratefull acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods goodnesse, with whose men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as wee begin our Prayers, so tis fit we end them. <hi>Quomodo cepit à laudibus Dei,</hi>

               <p>You see in what a qualified sense I call this Doxologie a Ceremony. I wish some
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:177033:172"/> others had not in a proper sense vsed it as a Ceremony, fit only to be annull'd and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Whether they were loth one Euangelist should speake more than another, for <hi>Luke</hi> hath it not at all; or whether they suspected that these words were additions to the Prayer, wanting the priuilege of our Sauiour, who was the Author, to make them Authenticall. <hi>Erasmus,</hi> it should seeme, was transported with this conceit, and hath not so much forfeited his Temper or Iudgement vpon any thing of like consequence, as this. For in his Notes vpon <hi>Matthew,</hi> he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily deliuers it, that<note n="*" place="margin">Magis taxan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da fait illorum temeritas, qui non veriti sunt tam diuinae pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationi suas nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gas assuere.

                  </note> they which annexed this Conclusion to the Lords Prayer, did patch vp the Prayer with their owne idle inuention, leauing a greater scorne vpon these words, which in good manners hee might haue left disputable whether they were Christs or no, than vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any Apocryphall writings, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controuersie he knew to be but mans. <hi>Maldonat</hi> the Iesuite deales more calmely,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:177033:172"/> he does not vilifie the words like <hi>Erasmus,</hi> but only seekes to excuse the Latines for leauing them out: Supposing, as <hi>Erasmus</hi> doth, that their vse began from the Greeke Church; who, he thinks, were like enough to make the addition here, as they added the <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> to the end of each Psalme, and likewise to the Angels Salutation of the blessed Virgin these words, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I will not looke so farre into the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Holy Ghost, as to dispute whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these words * were not borrowed from the speech of <hi>Dauid,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.11.<note place="margin">Cartwright Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spons.

               <p>This I am sure is granted on all parts, and confessed by <hi>Maldonat,</hi> that not onely the Septuagint, or the Fathers of the Greeke Church, <hi>Chrysostome, Theophylact,</hi> and <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thymius,</hi> recite the words, but the Hebrew and the Syriacke, which were the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Copies.

               </p>
               <p>Let then this truth be granted, that the Testaments Originally had this clause, and reason (if not authoritie which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighs <hi>Erasmus</hi>) will confirme vs, that this is no vnsuited Argument, patcht in to stuffe out the Prayer, but added as a most apposite and deuout Close, not only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our desires, that their maine scope must terminate in the Glory of God, but to teach vs that the seuerall Dictates and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:177033:173"/> Petitions of Christs Prayer are radicated and founded in God alone; To weaken thereby the pride of such who vainglori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously impute the successe of their Prayers rather to their owne merit than the mercy of God.

<pb n="351" facs="tcp:177033:181"/> and, in the rehearsall of his Titles, professe vnto Him how much is His, <hi>Thine is the Kingdome, the Power, and the Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet in this we imply a Dedication, a Deuoting of our selues to Him: For the ascribing of <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> to Him, imports the obedience, and subiection, and seruice which wee owe Him.</p>
               <p>Wee can neuer in the way of thankfull Debtors owe Him enough, who gaue his <hi>Only Sonne</hi> a Ransome for vs. Wee can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer giue Him too much Honour, who gaue vs all the Circumstances of our Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Nay, such is our Pouertie, wee cannot giue Him any Thing, but for a Gift are faine to tender Him a Repetition of His owne. Wee see by experience that it is no new thing for the bounty and munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of God to pose vs daily with new Blessings, or new Deliuerances from Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. But for vs to present Him with any new forme of Gratitude is impossible. As in the old Legall Sacrifices, Offerings were made vnto God of those Creatures which

               <p>The Keyes of those Faculties and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans wherewith wee praise Him, are in His Custodie: The Heart that prayes is in His Hand: The Spirit which vocally inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets the Heart is in the disposall of His Will. And therefore the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> will not presume to enter vpon the subiect of His Praise without leaue from Him: <hi>Domine labia mea aperies,</hi>

I did not buy the sacrifice, but receiued it from Thee; Twas not my Purchase, but thine owne Gift. Though Gods loue to Mankinde cost Him deare, yet our Thankes to Him costs
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:177033:182"/> little, tis at a most cheape rate. Such is his Bounty, and the riches of his Loue to vs, that He doth not only finde the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but build the Altar too; Hee is not only at the charge of the Offering, but of the Wood to dresse it. Hee bestowes the Holocaust, and Hee bestowes the Fewell. Hee obligeth vs first, and then prompts vs to a gratefull returne of that Obligation. Hee by his mercy giues vs cause to praise Him, and Hee by the working of his Grace inspires vs with a Duty and holy Zeale to ascribe this Praise. Thus wee pay God out of his owne Exchequer: Wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue from Him not only the Matter of our Thanksgiuing, but the Forme too; not only the Subiect of our Gratitude, but the expression of that Gratitude. As the Fauours wee receiue are His, so their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement is his also. These Organs of our Bodies are His, and the Musicke they make is by Him.

Certainly in the intent of Christ, the Dedication of these Attributes and of our Prayers to God is lame on our parts, and imperfect, if wee include not our selues in the Dedication, if wee are not able to say that as <hi>the Power and the Glory is Gods,</hi> so <hi>wee are His too.</hi>

               <p>Our Deed is now finished and ready for the <hi>Seale;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">6 <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </note> I must onely desire your helpe for the Impression of that <hi>Seale.</hi> It hath beene my Office, thorowout this whole Tract vpon <hi>Christs Prayer,</hi> only to Chafe the Wax, to informe, and mollifie, and prepare your Meditations, by kindling a Religious zeale in you. My part is done, and I must now expect somewhat from you. To shew that your hearts went along with mee in this holy exercise, to testifie your assent to the Dictates of Christ, that He spake no more to God for you, than
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:177033:184"/> you would be ready to speake ouer againe for your selues, you must now adde your Suffrage, since the remainder lies on you. For as it is the Priests duty to pray in the Temple, so tis the duty of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to say <hi>Amen</hi> to his Prayers.</p>
               <p>I know some Writers of the Roman Church endeuour to proue that None but the Priest should here say <hi>Amen.</hi> Indeed, to speake truth, in a Church where <hi>Prayer in an vnknowne Tongue</hi> is practised and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, where the People vnderstand not what the Priest sayes, <hi>S.

                  <hi>How shall the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned say Amen at thy giuing thanks, seeing hee vnderstandeth not what thou sayest?</hi> But in a Church where, for the most part I hope, wee doe, or should vnderstand one another; where, as neere as wee can, wee follow the Psalmists rule,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>To praise God with vnderstanding,</hi> there is no colour nor reason to leaue it onely to the Priests Mouth. Seeing that in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> no
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:177033:184"/> lesse than Twelue times the Command is iterated, <hi>Let all the People say Amen.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>It is then your worke. But since hee that offers at the Altar, is a party with the Congregation, and offers for himselfe too; Since the Priest in praying for others, prayes for himselfe, (for wee say <hi>Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and <hi>Forgiue vs</hi>) Since wee are not only Embassadours from God for your sakes, but Heraulds too, I will by your patience suruay this <hi>Seale,</hi> and Blazon the Coat which is engrauen in it, and then leaue it to be Affixed by you.</p>
